# Countdown Letters Game

This game, implemented in Ruby, is an adaptation of the letters game from the British game show "Countdown".

You can see an example of the game in action [here](https://youtu.be/JPNJHoOtBrg?t=191). To run the game, simply download all the files into a directory and enter the command

```
$ ruby game.rb
```

on a command window inside the game's directory.
